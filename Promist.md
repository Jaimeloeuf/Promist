# Promist

Promist is your list of Promises that you made to others.
This app helps you to keep track of all the Promises you made to others and allow you to set custom reminders for these Promises.

We don't want to go back on our words, and sometimes we just really forget about the promises that we made with others.
With this app, this will never happen again!
Just like a todo list, this is a todo list for the Promises you made!

This app is provided as a freemium software.
Upgradeable to use this Software as a Service with a subscription fee.
